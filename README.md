# DENV-genomics
In this repository one can find curated dengue virus (serotypes 1-4) coding complete genomes, as well as metadata pulled from GenBank on 2019.03.14. This repository also stores results of analyses performed using [nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org/) (see `auspice` directory).

## Sequences

Inside the directory `genomes` one can find alignments (`.fasta` files) of complete or near-complete DENV genomes (with trimmed UTRs). Viruses belonging to each serotype are split into individual files. Sequences are referenced with NCBI accession numbers (if previously published).

## Metadata

Also in the folder `genomes`, `.csv` files can be found, including metadata retrieved from public databases and/or obtained via personal communication. In these files one can find the following data about the genomes:

* accession number
* serotype
* genotype
* continent
* country-code
* country
* region
* sub-location1
* sub-location2
* latitude
* longitude
* isolation-date

## Nextstrain

Some of our analyses were performed using the nextstrain (`augur`) pipeline. These results can be visualized using `auspice`, accessing the link below:
