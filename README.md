# DENV-genomics
Curated dengue virus (serotypes 1-4) coding-complete genomes and metadata from GenBank.

## Sequences

The `.fasta` files are alignments of complete or near-complete DENV genomes (with trimmed UTRs). Viruses belonging to each serotype are split into individual files. Sequences are referenced with NCBI accession numbers (if previously published).

## Metadata

The `.csv` files contain metadata retrieved from public databases and/or obtained via personal communication. In these files one can find the following data about the genomes:

* accession number
* serotype
* genotype
* continent
* country-code
* country
* region
* sub-location1
* sub-location2
* latitude
* longitude
* isolation-date
